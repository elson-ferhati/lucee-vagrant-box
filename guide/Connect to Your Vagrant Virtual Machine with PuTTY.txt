A workaround is to use PuTTYgen (a free, open-source RSA and DSA key generation utility) to import and convert the insecure_private_key into PuTTY's format (a .ppk file). 

To do so, simply:

1) Run "vagrant ssh-config" in your Project Folder to locate where your Identityfile (private_key) is. Notice: $HOSTNAME $PORT $LOGINNAME
2) Open the PuTTYgen utility;
3) Click on the Load button;
4) open the Identityfile (it doesn't have an extension and that's fine with PuTTYgen)
5) Toward the bottom of the PuTTYgen dialog box, change the value in the Number of bits in a generated key: field to 2048, RSA is fine
6) Save the file, click "Save private key" (use a $NEW name and the .ppk extension).
